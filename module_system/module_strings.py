The king must be chosen from one of the leading noble families of the land, by a council drawn by lot from the patricians of the cities of Mediolanum, Veluca, and Yalen. The council meets on a field before Mediolanum, and no man is allowed to appear in arms during their deliberations, on pain of death."),
 # ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_1", "I was born in a faraway land, to a humble family, and made a slave when I was but a girl -- but there is no shame in that, for the mothers of many of our kings were slaves. The old Sultan, Ayzar, spotted me in the markets and was struck by my beauty. I entered his household, and there he also learned to respect my intelligence. As he grew older, he allowed me to govern in his stead. First I managed the affairs of the palace, and later those of the realm."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "Yet when my father died, his cousin Harlaus convinced the nobles that no Dacian king of sound mind could name a woman as his heir. Harlaus said that his designation of me was the act of a madman, and thus had no legal standing, and that he, as my father's closest male relative, should take the throne."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "I was smuggled abroad by a faithful servant, but now I am of age and have returned to reclaim what is rightfully mine. Burelek died soon after his act of perfidy -- the judgment of the gods, no doubt. His son Yaroglek now calls himself king, but as his claim is tainted, he is no less a usurper than his father, and I will topple him from his throne."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "According to Parthian custom, when a man dies his herds are split between all his sons, equally. So too it is with the khanate. When I heard of my father's death, I was away inspecting our borders, but I hurried home to Ctesiphon, ready to give Sanjar his due and share the khanate with him. But when I arrived, I found that he rushed his supporters to the court, to have himself proclaimed as the sole khan."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2",     "My father died however before I completed my course of study, and as I hurried home to claim his throne my ship was wrecked by a storm. One of my father's thanes, Ragnar, seized this opportunity and spread rumors that I had died abroad. He summoned a gathering of his supporters to have himself proclaimed king, and has taken the past few years to consolidate his power."),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "During the last selection, there were but two candidates, myself, and Lord Graveth. While the council was deliberating, Graveth appeared, sword in hand, telling them that a Dacian raiding party was about to descend on the field of deliberation -- which was true, by the way -- and if he were not elected king, then he would leave them to their fate."),
 # ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_2", "When Sultan Ayzar died, it seemed to the emirs of the realm only natural that I should succeed him as ruler, thus avoiding any danger of civil war. They insisted, however, that I should marry one of his generals, the Emir Baybak. The emirs then lined up to give us the oath of allegiance together -- to Baybak as Commander of the Armies, and to me as Mother of the Realm. For the brief time that we ruled, our realm prospered."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "I will admit that I did my cause no good by cursing Harlaus and all who listened to him as traitors, but I also believe that the magistrates who ruled in his favor were bought. No matter -- I will raise an army of loyal subjects, who would honour their old king's memory and will. And if anyone doubts that a woman can wield power, then I will prove them wrong by taking Harlaus' ill-gotten crown away from him."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Until I have my rights restored in the sight of all the Celts, I will bear the sobriquet, 'the Bastard', to remind me of what I must do."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "My brother thinks that Parthians will only respect strength: a leader who takes what he wants, when he wants it. But I think that he misreads the spirit of our people.--we admire a resolute leader, but even more we a just one, and we know that a man who does not respect his own brother's rights will not respect the rights of his followers."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3",     "So I remain in exile -- except now I am not looking for sages to tutor me in the wisdom of faraway lands, but warriors, to come with me back to the land of the Frisians and regain my throne. If Ragnar doubts my ability to rule, then let him say so face to face, as we stare at each other over the rims of our shields. For a warrior can be a scholar, and a scholar a warrior, and to my mind, only one who combines the two is fit to be king!"),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Well, Graveth defeated the Dacians, and for that, as a Armenian, I am grateful. When I am king, I will myself place the wreath of victory on his head. But after that I will have it separated from his shoulders, for by his actions he has shown himself a traitor to the Armenian confederacy and its sacred custom."),
  # ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_3", "But alas, Baybak himself was soon killed in a skirmish with the Parthians. Had I known of his death in time, I would have been able to prepare myself against any possibility of betrayal. But alas, my husband's treacherous nephew Hakim came riding with his men, still covered with the dust of the battlefield, and drove me from the palace at swordpoint and proclaimed himself sultan. So be it -- I shall gather an army of my own, and return him the favor."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "Retra thinks she should be Queen of the Dacians? Well, King Esterich had a kind heart, and doted on his daughter, but a good-hearted king who doesn't use his head can be a curse to his people. Retra may tell you stories of warrior queens of old, but you might also recall that all the old legends end in the same way -- with the Dacians crushed underfoot by the armies of the Roman Emperor."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "Were Langorix to come to me in peace, I would laden him with titles and honours, and he would become the greatest of my vassals. But as he comes in war, I will drag him before me in chains and make him acknowledge me as rightful sovereign, then cut his tongue from his mouth so that he cannot recant."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "My brother Penda has perhaps told you of his insistence upon splitting the khanate, as though it were a herd of sheep. Let me tell you something. Ever since the Parthians established themselves on this land, the death of every khan has had the same result -- the land was divided, the khan's sons went to war, and the strongest took it all anyway. I simply had the foresight to stave off the civil war in advance."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1",    "Olaf 'Far-Seeker'? Olaf Inkfingers, is more like it. Perhaps you have heard the expression, 'Unhappy is the land whose king is a child.' Unhappy too is the land whose king is a student. You want the Frisians to be ruled by a beardless youth, whose hand bears no callouses left by a sword's grip, who has never stood in a shield wall? If Olaf were king, his thanes would laugh at him to his face!"),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "No doubt David told you that I defiled the hallowed Armenian custom by interfering with the patricians' election of a king. Well, let me tell you something. The patricians of the towns make longwinded speeches about our ancient liberties, but then choose as their king whichever noble last sat in their villa and sipped a fine wine and promised to overlook their unpaid taxes."),
  # ("sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "Our scholars have long agreed that there is one overriding principle in politics. Men should accept the authority of the ruler, because tyranny is better than civil war. It was for that reason that I accepted the authority of both Baybak and Arwa, to whom I gave my oath as co-rulers."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Those who weep for the plight of a Dacian princess denied her father's throne should reflect instead on the fate of a Dacian herdswoman seized by a Celt raider and taken as chattel to the slave markets. Talk to me of queens and old stories when our warlike neighbors are vanquished, and our land is at peace."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "Whatever my father may or may not have done to secure the throne does not matter. I have inherited it, and that is final. If every old claim were to be brought up anew, if every man's inheritance could be called into question at any time, then it would be the end of the institution of kingship, and we would live in a state of constant civil war."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Penda would make a fine assessor of flocks, or adjudicator of land disputes. But can you imagine such a man as khan? We would be run off of our land in no time by our neighbors, and return to our old days of starving and freezing on the steppe."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2",    "Old Hakrim may have had fancy ideas about how to dispose of his kingdom, but it is not just royal blood that makes a King of the Frisians. I am king by acclamation of the thanes, and by right of being the strongest. That counts for more than blood, and woe to any man in this land who says otherwise."),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "The only liberty that concerns them is their liberty to grow fat. Meanwhile, my men sleep out on the steppe, and eat dry bread and salt fish, and scan the horizon for burning villages, and shed our blood to keep the caravan routes open. Here's an idea -- if I ever meet a merchant who limps from a Parthian arrow-wound or a Dacian sword-stroke, then I'll say, 'Here's a man whose counsel is worth taking.'"),
  # ("sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "You should know, however, that Arwa was not chosen as Baybak's partner because of her wisdom or love of justice. No, she was chosen because she was a witch, who could transform men like Ayzar and Baybak into stammering fools. No matter -- I was true to my oath, and respected her usurpation, until the very hour that it was invalidated by the death of her puppet. Now she must respect mine."),

Occasionally a metal shoulder shield (galerus) was added to protect the neck and lower face.

This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon, but a recent discovery of a "

A variation to the normal combat was a retiarius facing two secutores at the same time. The retiarus stood on a bridge or raised platform with stairs and had a pile of fist-sized stones to throw at his adversaries. While the retiarius tried to keep them at bay, the secutores tried to scale the structure to attack him. The platform, called a pons (bridge), may have been constructed over water. Retiarii usually fought Secutores but sometimes fought Myrmillones."

However, when he died, his will was ignored, and the kingdom was annexed and his property taken. According to Tacitus, Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped.

  # ("journey_to_reyvadin", "You have come through the Celt highlands, a plateau exposed to the bitter winds from the north. The land here is frozen for most of the year, but the forests are rich with fur-bearing game, and the rivers are teaming with fish. The riches of the land draw the traders, but the traders in turn draw bandits. You saw the occasional dark figure mounted on a shaggy pony, watching the passage of your caravan from a snowy ridge, and were glad when the spires of Panticapaeum came into view across the wide valley of the Boluk river."),
  # ("journey_to_praven", "You came by caravan through the heartland of the known world. Green shoots of wheat, barley and oats are beginning to push through the dark soil of the rolling hills, and on the lower slopes of the snowcapped mountains, herds of cattle and sheep are grazing on the spring grass. Occasionally, too, you catch sight of one of the great warhorses that are the pride of the Dacian nobility. The land here is rich -- but also troubled, as the occasional burnt-out farm bears witness. You keep a wide berth of the forests, where desperate men have taken refuge, and it is some relief when you crest a ridge and catch sight of the great port of Rome, its rooftops made golden by the last rays of the setting sun."),
  # ("journey_to_jelkala", "You came by ship, skirting the cliffs where the Armenian highlands meet the sea. Much of the coastline was obscured by tendrils of fog that snaked down the river valleys, but occasionally you caught sight of a fortress watchtower rising above the mists -- and on one occasion, a beacon fire burning to warn of an enemy warband. You knew that you were relatively safe at sea, as you were too far south to risk encountering the sea raiders who trouble the coasts of the Nordic lands, but it was still a relief to reach the Selver estuary, gateway to the port of Mediolanum, and see a Armenian galley riding at anchor, its pennants fluttering in the evening breeze."),
  # ("journey_to_sargoth", "You took passage with a trading longship, carrying gyrfalcons from the furthest reaches of the north to be bartered for linen and wool. It sailed early in the season, but the master reckoned that the risks of drifting ice and later winter storms could be justified by arriving ahead of the Sea Raiders, who by April would be sailing forth from their island lairs to ravage the known world's coasts. It was some relief when your ship came in sight of the delta of the Vyl and Boluk rivers, and a short while later, rowed past tidal flats and coastal marshes to the city of Eboracum, home to the Sea Raiders' distant kinsmen, the Nordic lords, who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but troubled land."),
  # ("journey_to_tulga", "You came with a caravan, crossing the mountains that border the known world on the north and east, bringing spices from faraway lands to trade for wool and salt. The passes were still choked with snow, and it was hard going, but at last you crested a ridge and saw before you the europaen steppes. On some hillsides the thin grass of spring was already turning yellow, but the lower slopes of the mountains were still a vibrant green. Herds of sheep and tawny steppe ponies drifted across them like clouds, testifying to the wealth of the Parthian khans. From time to time small groups of horsemen would follow your caravan from a distance, perhaps sizing up how well you could defend the wealth you carried, so it was with some relief that you saw the towers of Ctesiphon rising up from the plains."),
  # ("journey_to_shariz", "You came with a caravan, crossing the great desert to the east of the known world. The bedouin guides chose your route carefully, leapfrogging through treacherous dune fields and across empty gravel plains to low-lying oases rich with orchards and date palms. Your great fear was that the caravan might lose its way and perish of thirst. The small bands of raiders who hovered just out of bowshot, waiting to pick off stragglers, were oddly a comfort -- at least water could be no more than a day's ride away. It was a great relief when the mountains came into view, and on the evening of the following day you crested a rocky pass and in the distance could make out the sea, and the towers of Shariz silhouetted against the sunset."),

To use it best, the Roman ships were equipped with a Corvus -- a giant rotating bridge that made boarding enemy ships easier. The fleets were so big that they broke up into several groups, who engaged in separate battles. In the end, the Roman center prevailed, and ships engaged there now turned to help the other groups, routing Carthage again and again.

Their ad-hoc resistance was quickly overwhelmed and most were killed or enslaved."),

Either way, there are forces in the sea stronger than the world's strongest navy and they better be respected."),

Instead of surrendering, however, Rome doubled its resolve. After 30 days of mourning, the word 'peace' was outlawed and crying in public was banned.

("discovery_reg1_text1", "Our expedition made its way up the river Nile in search of its origin. We battled enormous crocodiles and even brought back a murderous hippopotamus, that claimed the life of our priest. After many hundreds of turns, Nile becomes a sprawling swamp, overgrown with thick lush vegetation. We could not walk on it, nor could our heavy boats make way through it. Friendly local people tell us that the river continues beyond this swampy Sudd, as they call it, but we could not find a way through the green labyrinth. Without the priest, local gods have forsaken us and many men fell sick and died. After half were dead, we turned back. We must try again and this time keep the priests better guarded from those vicious hippos."),

("discovery_reg1_text2", "We have successfully pierced the treacherous Sudd marshes in the upper reaches of the Nile, using very light boats. Beyond it, the river continues for a long time, sometimes swelling into enormous freshwater lakes so big that you cannot see any shore while on it. The vegetation is thick and green, and the air gets hot and very wet unlike in the deserts of Aegyptus. There are tales of a great mountain where the gods live, and we saw its massive hulk going into the clouds from the distance, but could not attempt an ascent. With our best mountaineers, we should mount an expedition to climb it and place your flag at the summit!"),

("discovery_reg1_text3", "Forgive us, great Caesar, for we have failed. The best mountaineers have made way with our expedition to the foot of the great mountain beyond the marshes of Sudd and the lakes of upper Nile. We have ascended through the clouds, over deep cracks and on steep ledges. We have gone so high that unbearable heat turned into unbearable cold and snow and ice was everywhere around us. We have gone as high as we could, but then the gods from above sent their spirits to stop us. The spirits would draw the air out of our mouths and make the men suffocate, they would lull men to sleep only to make them slip and fall to their deaths, and they would make men see and hear things that were not there. As the spirits overtook us all, we were forced to turn back down. We could not place your flag at the summit, oh Caesar, because it is occupied by the gods."),

("discovery_reg1_text4", "We have found it! We have followed the river Nile, faced many dangers, to bring you tales of the sacred source, where gods gift us the water, which feeds Aegyptus' most fertile valley in the middle of hostile desert sands. Divine Caesar, beyond the marshes of Sudd, before the great unscalable mountain, just at the end of the first great lake, the river Nile splits. Its eastern branch leads to a great lake that is so big, it takes days to sail across. This lake is filled by a great spring, bursting straight from dead stone in a mighty divine gush of life-giving water that sustains hundreds of different peoples downstream, who are so diverse they can barely understand each other, before disappearing into Mare Nostrum. We have brought many pebbles from the source, as reminders of your discovery for the people of Rome."),

("discovery_reg1_text5", "Oh Caesar, you may have seen them return, riding atop the striped zebra horses, to the awe of gawkers all over Rome. The zebras are for you, of course, but it's where they came from that is more interesting. ^We landed on the southeast shore of the great lake, where the Nile begins, and moved inland. Unlike the lush green forests on the other side, the lands there are arid and mostly flat. Rare trees stand here and there, and grass covers the rest. Animals roam these plains in gargantuan herds -- they fill the horizon as far as the eye can see, a mass more numerous than all the people of Rome and packed even tighter. No predator dare challenge them, and the mightiest legion would be overrun and trampled into dust if such a herd moved over them."),

("discovery_reg1_text6", "We have more curious news from the great Serengi plains. The Maasai tribes inhabiting this land have a curious belief that gods willed them alone all the cattle in the world. Any outsider keeping domestic cattle or hunting the great herds that roam the land here, therefore, is transgressing. ^We have managed to establish cordial relations with these people, however, and learned much of their customs. Life is so harsh for them, that a baby born is not recognized for the first three months, lest it dies. ^The lion is both their totemic animal and prey for a ritual hunt, where boys prove themselves to become men. We thought it best not to mention that in Rome we slaughter lions for amusement, oh Caesar. ^As a gift to you, the Maasai sent a camelopard -- a long-necked camel with a spotted coat."),

("discovery_reg1_text7", "The Maasai inhabitants of the Serengi plains have taken us to a place they call Mountain of God. Their god must have been quite angry one day, because all the remains of the mountain is the greatest volcanic crater anyone has ever seen! The inside of the crater is over ten miles wide, filled with lush grass, a lake, and teeming wildlife. Lions, elephants and hippos share this crater with wild cattle, and the views are breathtaking."),

("discovery_reg1_text8", "Oh Caesar, there are only a few survivors remaining to tell the tale of why the great Serengi plains are so sparsely populated. Though most of our men died by Maasai spear, they might as well have been killed by the monstrous giant blood-sucking flies called Tsetse. They are as big as a child's finger and attack man and beast, feasting on blood. Cattle are especially vulnerable, and die in great numbers from sickness that follows. People survive, but without animals farming can only be done by hand and famine ensues. It was especially bad during out stay, which caused our previously gracious hosts to turn hostile... We best avoid this area for a while."),

("discovery_reg1_text9", "Our fleet has sailed west out of the Mare Nostrum and down south along the coast of Africa, exploring its shores. As you know, the big waters are rough and wrathful storms are common. However, as we turned around the bend of the shore and headed east, no coastal village could tell us anything to suggest big storms happened to them. By all accounts, it looks like the seas farther south are blessed by Neptune and safe to sail! ^We have explored much of the coast and brought detailed accounts of every settlement from the shore bend all the way to the great river that flows from the north into the ocean."),

("discovery_reg1_text10", "Oh, Divine, the great river flowing south through western African lands turns out to be no other than Gir and Niger that we know from travellers who crossed the deserts south of Numidia. It was thought these rivers flow into the Nile through a series of underground passages, but clearly it does not. Many people live along its shores. Most lands only just give enough sustinence to small villages, but some are fertile enough to support cities, producing interesting pottery and art, mining for metals and building places to honor their gods. ^Perhaps we can establish trade with them along the sea route."),

("discovery_reg1_text11", "Divine Caesar, we have discovered the Underworld! Evil Lemures, the spectral ghosts of old Roman tales, who wander the night to torment the living, are numerous on the large island far south and off the eastern coast of Africa. ^The entire land is steeped in magic. No animal or plant is anything we have seen anywhere in the world. There are leafs that turn into lizards, giant chameleons the size of a cat, who turn invisible and sneak up to steal your food. At night, the dark forest lights up with thousands of burning yellow eyes, accompanied by howling of creatures we dared not confront. ^It is a place best left alone."),
#asia
("discovery_reg2_text1", "Divine Caesar, we have traveled the many kingdoms of India and brought back precious pearls, gems, and many stories of their people's traditions. Most impressively, we have brought five of the biggest, fiercest predators they call tigers. They are enormous cats, bigger than even a lion, striped and very aggressive! The Amphitheater rarely sees an animal that could rival them."),

("discovery_reg2_text2", "Our expedition did not quite go as planned, but it was a resounding success, oh Caesar. Our ship has hit a storm on the way to India and try as we might, it was impossible to make progress north against the big waves and howling winds. The ghosts sent by Neptune himself whispered for us to turn south. ^As we did, we discovered a chain of islands, which their Dheyvi inhabitants call Divi. It is the most beautiful place in the world, with white sand beaches and water clear and pure as a Vestal Virgin's teardrop. Palm trees there produce bug round nuts with a hard shell, soft white fiber, and a milky juice inside. ^The place is an empire, in the middle of the sea, spread over thousands of little islands. Could this be Atlantis?"),

("discovery_reg2_text3", "We have searched all of India to bring you this incredible deadly animal, Divine Caesar. Many lands have deadly snakes, of course. Cleopatra, famously, was killed by one of Aegyptus' serpents. But it usually takes a bite, and a man in proper leg armor would be safe from all but the most deceitful of snakes, while a good spearman can cut a snake in half before she can strike him. ^Not this serpent! This, oh Caesar, is the most treacherous spitting cobra. It can launch its venom like a javelin, hitting its enemy at great distance. Its venom is very potent, too. Any man unfortunate enough to be hit by it will face certain death."),

("discovery_reg2_text4", "Divine Caesar, we have visited the great big island of Taprobana, which almost touches the southern tip of India. It is a wealthy land, a key stop in many trade routes leading for spices and luxuries leading to lands even farther east. ^What impressed us the most, oh Caesar, is their enormous waterworks. We Romans have our great aqueducts, bringing clean water to our big cities, but these people's structures can rival ours.

("lecture_1_1", "In the following lectures, I will talk about the Platonian notion of justice, and how Platon describes the ideal state. I will begin with justice in Platonian philosophy. ^^What is justice? One could say: Justice is to help and support your friends and to harm your enemies. Or equivalently, one could say: Everyone shall get what he deserves. But what if you misjudge people: If you view a just and good person as an enemy; then you harm him and you view this as just. But it can't be just, to harm an innocent person. And what about people who are befriended with bad ones and enemies to good ones? They would have to support bad people and harm good people. That can't be just."),
("lecture_1_2", "What if one defines justice as the following: Justice is what is advantageous to the stronger, while injustice is to one's own profit and advantage. For example, rulers of states make laws to their advantage and define what is just with these laws. But also rulers make mistakes. It could be that a ruler issues a law to their disadvantage. If now the subordinate obeys the law, he will harm the ruler. Thus it can happen that it is just to harm the ruler. But this contradicts the definition: Just is what gives advantages to the stronger."),
("lecture_1_3", "But what is now just and what is justice? There are two notions of justice: one for the society as whole and one for each individual. In an ideal society, just is the willingness of a citizen to perform tasks, which he is able to perform naturally. Those tasks define his natural standing in society. Injustice happens, if those areas of responsibility are despised. An individual is just, if the parts of his soul, namely reason, spirit, and appetite, have the right proportion. For example, it is not just if a coward becomes a soldier and a brave, strong man a scholar. This finishes the first lecture."),


("lecture_2_1", "Today, I want to talk about the five main forms of government and how they are linked together. I will highlight this with a fictional example. Let's start with the best form: the rule of the best, aristokratia. Only a few of the best citizens rule the state. But this is usually not a stable form of government. Sooner or later, unqualified people will come into leading positions. Greedy landowners will try to amass wealth and land for their own use. The competent people remaining must make compromises with the landowners to avoid civil war. A timekratia emerges, the rule of the property owners. As the ones who own most properties will be the most powerful. But now a certain fraction of people will become wealthier and wealthier. The wealthiest will become fewer until only a small number of landowners will rule; an oligarchia has developed. To advance in society, people try all ways to amass wealth. Poverty and banditry will spread. "),
("lecture_2_2", "Soon the poor population will rise up and revolt. A new government form emerges now, the demokratia, the rule of the people. Freedom is the new main value. Nobody is obligated to do anything; all are free to choose.^^But this cannot go well for long. Sooner or later, laws will be neglected and disorder will reign. The unrestricted desire for freedom will lead to the government's downfall, as it will devolve into anarchy. A democratic citizen does not want an authority over him. The ones who rule flatter the people in an attempt to stay in charge and get re-elected. Children start to lose respect for their parents, their teachers, and adults in general. And there is still the difference between poor and rich, as the uprising could not overcome it. But this unequal distribution of wealth contradicts the values of democracy."),
("lecture_2_3", "Thus, people will start following a demagogue who promises to end this inequality. The wealthy will become scared and try to imprison him. But he will found a militia. A civil war starts, the demagogue wins, and finally, the government form of tyrannis emerges.^^The tyrann will start his rule with the redistribution of land and by rewarding supporters. Then he will start a war to focus all attention on a foreign enemy and to make himself indispensable. Possible enemies will be killed or sent to war. The tyrann needs to hire more troops to establish a system of monitoring his people. This is expensive. More taxes will be collected. The highest form of servitude has developed.^I want to make some remarks: This was only an example to highlight the five fundamental types of government:  aristokratia, timekratia, oligarchia, demokratia and tyrannis. There also exist mixtures of those types. This example should also highlight some general processes and show how different forms can transform into each other."),


("lecture_3_1", "In this lecture, I want to talk about the ideal state as Platon describes it.^^What is the ideal state? We start from our notion of justice: The ideal state shall be a just one, thus everybody should do what he can do best. Consider a captain and his ship: not everyone is capable of being a captain. Or a doctor: not everyone is capable of treating wounds. So ideally, one would part the people in three groups or classes: one class of producers; they are good at producing goods. For example, tailors or smiths. The warrior class: they are brave and strong, thus good warriors. And finally, the ruler class: Those are the most intelligent, rational, and self-controlled people, who love wisdom and learning. Those are well suited to make decisions for the whole state."),
("lecture_3_2", "Now to some radical consequences: To ensure everyone belongs to the right class and to prevent any physical bond with the parents, newborn children will not be groomed by their parents, but instead by educators. Both boys and girls will receive the same education. In particular, there is no difference between men and women: If a woman is strong and brave, she will become a warrior. If she is intelligent enough, she will become a philosopher. The state plans the reproduction of the population to groom good citizens and to ensure a stable population. Newborns and children with disabilities are killed, as is already tradition in most societies, as they are not useful for the state."),
("lecture_3_3", "Education in arts and physique is important: Who is not capable and does not understand things like mathematics during this step of education will become a farmer or worker. The others have the chance to become warriors, or even rulers, according to their abilities. It is also important to forbid that harmful myths are told. There are many traditional myths which tell tales of fear or of gods who behave shamefully. Such myths are not allowed to be told in an ideal state, as they instill fear, make death something to be feared, and incite shameful behaviour.^^As you can see, this concept is not realisable in reality. In the next lecture, I will talk about a more realistic approach: the second best state."),


("lecture_4_1", "Today is our final lecture relevant to the exam. I will tell of what Platon calls the second best state, a more realistic version of the ideal state. We abound the idea of philosopher rulers, as too much power concentrated in a handful of people tends to corrupt. Instead, it is a good approach to have a mixture of all the state forms discussed before. Above all, there should be no people, but laws, as people tend to corrupt. All citizens should have the possibility of charging anyone, even the state, of wrongdoing. Every law should be formulated in a meaningful way, to ensure it is understandable. Hence, the citizens will respect the law, as they understand why it is necessary."),
("lecture_4_2", "In opposition to the ideal state, there are still families and private property. Instead of philosophers, all citizens have the opportunity to participate in politics. Though there is still a requirement for offices: Only capable people are allowed to hold an office. Although families still exist, people will have an extensive education. To ensure laws are not violated, it is important that the citizens control each other. In particular, that they can charge other citizens if they break the law. Finally, there needs to be an additional institution to control the government. Platon called it the nightly assembly. Its members are capable citizens with a proper philosophical education. This assembly cannot make laws, but only controls and interprets laws which are issued by the government."),
("lecture_4_3", "The second best state should be realisable in reality. The most crucial part is to have different institutions which control each other. As Platon observed correctly, power concentrated into a few persons will corrupt; power concentrated into one person will corrupt totally. The only way to prevent corruption is to have control divested between people of various offices and institutions. Given that, there is hope that the state will develop in a good direction.^^This ends our last lecture relevant for the exam. I will also give a small lecture about other schools as a kind of bonus, but this will not be relevant for the exam."),
#bonus
("lecture_5_1", "Welcome to my bonus lecture. We mainly teach Platonian philosophy here, but I also want to give you some general overview of other schools. I will first talk about Stoicism, Pythagoras, and Epikur.^^Let's begin with Epikur. Epikur taught that pleasure is the quintessence; especially pleasure of the mind, not necessarily physical pleasure. Unnecessary and artificial desires are to be suppressed, such as lust for power and fame."),
("lecture_5_2", "Epikur also recommended against passionate love and to avoid marriage. For him, the basis of a satisfying life is friendship. Though, he also taught not to fear death or any gods. In terms of politics, Epikur taught all people are naturally equal, as they are made of the same elements. However, he discouraged involvement in politics and even from founding a family, as a wife and children mean more trouble than they are worth.^^Enough about this. Let's continue with Pythagoras. He used mainly numbers and mathematics for his arguments.  For instance, the number 1 symbolizes the intellect and being, the number 2, thought. 4 is related to justice as 2*2=4."),
("lecture_5_3", "The most important number was the 3, as Pythagoras thought, that the whole world, everything, is summed up in this number. It also had another meaning: According to him, the goodness of each person is threefold: prudence, drive, and good fortune. In terms of justice, he said, that each part shall receive its due, which is ensured by proportion.^^Finally, let's also talk about Stoicism. The main idea is to develop a healthy self-control to overcome any destructive emotions. One should become a clear and universal thinker. Only then one can understand the universal reason of the world, which they call logos. The goal is to reach inner calm. One can reach it by becoming free of passions, meaning, free of anguish and suffering. Thank you for coming to my optional lecture, and study hard for your exams."),

  "The Garamantes were an ancient civilization based in the southern region of Libya. They were descended from Berber tribes and Saharan pastoralists, and their civilization emerged around 1000 BC, "

  +"the Fezzan region of southern Libya, and they established the first urban society in a major desert not centered on a river system. "
  +"^^Historical references to the Garamantes date back to the 5th century BC, with Herodotus describing them as a significant nation involved in cattle herding and date farming. Roman writers had mixed "
  +"perceptions of the Garamantes, with some describing them as having diverse racial types. The Garamantes were known for bearing ritual scars and tattoos, and they engaged in conflicts with Roman forces. "
  +"The decline of their culture may have been due to worsening climatic conditions and the overuse of water resources. "
  +"^^The Garamantes built an extensive network of tunnels and shafts to extract fossil water, known as foggaras. This allowed agriculture to thrive in the desert, and slave labor was used to maintain these "
  +"systems. The Tichitt culture may have contributed to Garamantian culture in areas such as domestic architecture and ceramics. "

  +"Roman perceptions of the Gaetuli varied, with some early accounts portraying them as uncivilized, while later accounts acknowledged ethnic diversity among Berber tribes. "
  +"Roman records show that the Gaetuli played a role in the Jugurthine War and the Bellum Octavianum, and they later engaged in the Gaetulian War. They also provided "

  +"The Gaetuli had a diverse lifestyle due to the region's varying climates. They lived in huts in mountainous areas but some were also nomads in the deserts. "
  +"They were known for their warlike tendencies and frequent invasions, targeting both Roman territories and other Numidian tribes. The Gaetuli often intermarried with other tribes.^^ "

"
  +"^Description of the breastplate of the statue:^^The figure in the centre, according to the most common interpretation, is the subjected Parthian king (Phraates IV) returning Crassus's standard to an armored Roman (possibly Tiberius, or symbolically Mars Ultor or the incarnation of the ideal legionary). Other theory sees in the male figure the ideal incarnation of the Roman legions. This was a very popular subject in Augustan propaganda, as one of his greatest international successes, and had to be especially strongly emphasized, since Augustus had been deterred by Parthian military strength from the war which the Roman people had expected and had instead opted for diplomacy. Below the armed figure we can see a dog, or probably a wolf or, according to archaeologist Ascanio Modena Altieri, a she-wolf, nurse of Romulus and Remus. To the left and right sit mourning female figures. A figure to one side with a sheathed sword personifies the peoples in the East (and possibly the Teutons) forced to pay tribute to Rome, and one on the other side with an unsheathed sword personifies the subjected peoples (the Celts). From the top, clockwise, we see: "
  +"^-Caelus, the sky god, spreading the tent of the sky"
  +"^-Aurora and Luna"
  +"^-the personification of the subjected peoples"
  +"^-the goddess Diana"
  +"^-the earth goddess Ceres/Tellus - similarly represented on the Ara Pacis"

It has traditionally been assumed to be a type of shared anal wiping utensil used after defecating, and the sponge cleaned in vinegar or water.
